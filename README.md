**This is a work in progress project, the API is not fully implemented, the NPM module is not published.<br>
At this time only the Playground broker is fully supported. Please create an issue for questions.**

## Installation
The easiest way to install Mida is using the following command in your project directory.
```console
npm install @reiryoku/mida
```

## Usage
This project is incomplete! Parts of the API may not be implemented or have different configurations.
For contributions please create an issue.
The objective is creating a common API allowing to operate in financial markets with MetaTrader, cTrader and the other independent brokers APIs.

## Disclaimer
Operating in CFDs/Forex is highly speculative and carries a high level of risk.
It's possible to lose all your capital. These products may not be suitable for everyone,
you should ensure that you understand the risks involved. Furthermore, Mida is not responsible
for commissions or other taxes applied to your operations, they depend on your broker,
and any technical inconvenience that may lead to money loss, for example a stop loss not being set.

## Why Mida and not MQL
Nowadays MQL is a procedural technology and a barrier between
modern traders and algorithmic trading. The mission of Mida is allowing
anyone to operate in financial markets without advanced programming skills or
specific computer requirements. Furthermore, Mida allows operating with MetaTrader
accounts without installing MetaTrader (which is available only for Windows OS).
